** Selections from manpage
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     -A num, --after-context=num
             Print num lines of trailing context after each match.  See also the
             -B and -C options.

     -a, --text
             Treat all files as ASCII text.  Normally grep will simply print
             ``Binary file ... matches'' if files contain binary characters.  Use
             of this option forces grep to output lines matching the specified
             pattern.

     -B num, --before-context=num
             Print num lines of leading context before each match.  See also the
             -A and -C options.

     -b, --byte-offset
             The offset in bytes of a matched pattern is displayed in front of
             the respective matched line.

     -C[num, --context=num]
             Print num lines of leading and trailing context surrounding each
             match.  The default is 2 and is equivalent to -A 2 -B 2.  Note: no
             whitespace may be given between the option and its argument.

     -c, --count
             Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output.

     -D action, --devices=action
             Specify the demanded action for devices, FIFOs and sockets.  The
             default action is `read', which means, that they are read as if they
             were normal files.  If the action is set to `skip', devices will be
             silently skipped.

     -d action, --directories=action
             Specify the demanded action for directories.  It is `read' by
             default, which means that the directories are read in the same man-
             ner as normal files.  Other possible values are `skip' to silently
             ignore the directories, and `recurse' to read them recursively,
             which has the same effect as the -R and -r option.

     -e pattern, --regexp=pattern
             Specify a pattern used during the search of the input: an input line
             is selected if it matches any of the specified patterns.  This
             option is most useful when multiple -e options are used to specify
             multiple patterns, or when a pattern begins with a dash (`-').

     --exclude
             If specified, it excludes files matching the given filename pattern
             from the search.  Note that --exclude patterns take priority over
             --include patterns, and if no --include pattern is specified, all
             files are searched that are not excluded.  Patterns are matched to
             the full path specified, not only to the filename component.

     --exclude-dir
             If -R is specified, it excludes directories matching the given file-
             name pattern from the search.  Note that --exclude-dir patterns take
             priority over --include-dir patterns, and if no --include-dir pat-
             tern is specified, all directories are searched that are not
             excluded.

     -F, --fixed-strings
             Interpret pattern as a set of fixed strings (i.e. force grep to
             behave as fgrep).

     -f file, --file=file
             Read one or more newline separated patterns from file.  Empty pat-
             tern lines match every input line.  Newlines are not considered part
             of a pattern.  If file is empty, nothing is matched.

     -H      Always print filename headers with output lines.

     -h, --no-filename
             Never print filename headers (i.e. filenames) with output lines.

     --help  Print a brief help message.

     -I      Ignore binary files.  This option is equivalent to
             --binary-file=without-match option.

     -i, --ignore-case
             Perform case insensitive matching.  By default, grep is case sensi-
             tive.

     --include
             If specified, only files matching the given filename pattern are
             searched.  Note that --exclude patterns take priority over --include
             patterns.  Patterns are matched to the full path specified, not only
             to the filename component.

     --include-dir
             If -R is specified, only directories matching the given filename
             pattern are searched.  Note that --exclude-dir patterns take prior-
             ity over --include-dir patterns.

     -L, --files-without-match
             Only the names of files not containing selected lines are written to
             standard output.  Pathnames are listed once per file searched.  If
             the standard input is searched, the string ``(standard input)'' is
             written.

     -l, --files-with-matches
             Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to
             standard output.  grep will only search a file until a match has
             been found, making searches potentially less expensive.  Pathnames
             are listed once per file searched.  If the standard input is
             searched, the string ``(standard input)'' is written.

     -m num, --max-count=num
             Stop reading the file after num matches.

     -n, --line-number
             Each output line is preceded by its relative line number in the
             file, starting at line 1.  The line number counter is reset for each
             file processed.  This option is ignored if -c, -L, -l, or -q is
             specified.

     --null  Prints a zero-byte after the file name.

     -O      If -R is specified, follow symbolic links only if they were explic-
             itly listed on the command line.  The default is not to follow sym-
             bolic links.

     -o, --only-matching
             Prints only the matching part of the lines.

     -p      If -R is specified, no symbolic links are followed.  This is the
             default.

     -q, --quiet, --silent
             Quiet mode: suppress normal output.  grep will only search a file
             until a match has been found, making searches potentially less
             expensive.

     -R, -r, --recursive
             Recursively search subdirectories listed.

     -S      If -R is specified, all symbolic links are followed.  The default is
             not to follow symbolic links.

     -s, --no-messages
             Silent mode.  Nonexistent and unreadable files are ignored (i.e.
             their error messages are suppressed).

     -U, --binary
             Search binary files, but do not attempt to print them.

     -V, --version
             Display version information and exit.

     -v, --invert-match
             Selected lines are those not matching any of the specified patterns.

     -x, --line-regexp
             Only input lines selected against an entire fixed string or regular
             expression are considered to be matching lines.

     -y      Equivalent to -i.  Obsoleted.

     --binary-files=value
             Controls searching and printing of binary files.  Options are
             binary, the default: search binary files but do not print them;
             without-match: do not search binary files; and text: treat all files
             as text.

     --context[=num]
             Print num lines of leading and trailing context.  The default is 2.

     --line-buffered
             Force output to be line buffered.  By default, output is line
             buffered when standard output is a terminal and block buffered oth-
             erwise.

     If no file arguments are specified, the standard input is used.

EXIT STATUS
     The grep utility exits with one of the following values:

     0     One or more lines were selected.
     1     No lines were selected.
     >1    An error occurred.

STANDARDS
     The grep utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (``POSIX.1'')
     specification.

     The flags [-AaBbCDdGHhIJLmoPRSUVwZ] are extensions to that specification,
     and the behaviour of the -f flag when used with an empty pattern file is
     left undefined.

     All long options are provided for compatibility with GNU versions of this
     utility.

     Historic versions of the grep utility also supported the flags [-ruy].  This
     implementation supports those options; however, their use is strongly dis-
     couraged.
